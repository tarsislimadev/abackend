# Installing

Assuming youâ€™ve already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), create a directory to hold your application, and make that your working directory.

```sh
$ mkdir myapp

$ cd myapp
```

Use the npm init command to create a package.json file for your application. 

```sh
$ npm init -y
```

Install ABACKEND in the `myapp` directory and save it in the dependencies list.

```sh
$ npm i abackend
```

To install ABACKEND temporarily and not add it to the dependencies list.

```sh
$ npm install abackend --no-save
```
